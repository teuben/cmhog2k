This is 'cmhog', revision 2 (cmhog2). A PPM code to simulate the 2D gas
flow in a barred galaxy. It is based on the code Piner, Stone and Teuben
published in their 1995 (ApJ xxx,yyy) article.

Although the code stands alone, it is useful to have the MIRIAD, and
especially, NEMO package around. See hydro.tex in the documentation
tree for suggestions how to use the code.

Some of the tools may be reproduced in $NEMO/src/image/hdf/cmhog, although
we attempt to keep the two synchronized

Updates:

September 2002:
    piner94.src can now initialize an internal grid for testing
	 $pgrid $ 
    is needed in cmhogin. 
    a potential on a grid can now be read in, and gas   (TODO)

April 2003:
    piner94.src : added vhalo,rhalo to  /pgrid/
    


Known problems:

- numeric grid potential from barred potential not stable enough


Major Bug Fix: (2011)

This version is the version we got from Woon-Tae Kim, where the two
errors in force and bar orientation were fixed. It was forked of
some earlier version of the "cmhog2" version,hence (for now) the need
to keep a separate module. The intent is to merge the two.

If you don't have HDF4, and want to install it from within cmhog2k,
do this:

   cd cmhog2k			# go whereever cmhog2k shows the src/ and exe/
   cvs co hdf4
   cd hdf4
   ./configure --prefix=`pwd`	# if that fails, look at config.log why it failed
   	       			# you may have missing components. Use --help to
				# get help on valid configure options.
				# and/or rerun with things like --without-zlib
   make clean
   make
   make install                 # this will place all bin's and lib's within hdf4 tree

   cd ../src			# now continue back in cmhog2k
   cp Makefile.gfortran Makefile     # pretty decent default Makefile, bypassing configure
      				     # you might still have to edit this
   make compile                      # compile it, it places cmhog in ../exe
